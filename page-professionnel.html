    <p>In the next 3 or 5 years I see myself continuing my studies and taking the cyber security course even if I'm not sure yet, after the GOAL I see myself starting to work, I don't really know yet what I want to do it later but I'm still looking! If I continue my studies I am thinking of looking into an engineering school.</p>
    <p>I never really had the chance to know what I wanted to do later, which is why I did research until I found the Networks and Telecommunications training. If I don't like it, I'm thinking of reorienting myself by doing research, going to see guidance counselors, etc...   </p>
