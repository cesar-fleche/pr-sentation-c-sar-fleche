        <p>My group of friends is made up of 13 people but I'm only going to introduce a few of them, it's a group that was formed from middle school to high school with new people. </p>
        <p>These are all people that I was lucky enough to know at Carnot College in Paris in the 17th arrondissement. </p>

        <p>the <strong>bodybuilding</strong> is the sport that I practice the most despite the fact that it is increasingly complicated to practice it in Blois because the nearest gym is about a 30-minute walk away.</p><p>Last year when I still lived in Paris, there was a room right next to my house which was much easier. </p>
        <p>The exercises that I enjoy the most are the bench press and the dumbbell bench press, which are two exercises that work the pecs.</p>

        </div> 
        <p class="ma-classe">The two exercises above are very good exercises for working the pectorals mainly but also the triceps and shoulders which are the muscles that I prefer to work.</p>
