    <p>My name is <strong>César Flèche</strong> I am recently 18 years old. I was born on 09/17/2005 in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 92, I lived all my life in Paris until when I was 17 when I moved alone to Blois for studies…</p>
    <p>I went to two high schools, the first was Edgard Quinet in the 9th arrondissement, I generally progressed there from the second to the first then I decided to change high schools to go to sti2d in the high school chaptal in the 17th. So I followed the rest of my schooling in a sti2d baccalaureate by following the ITEC course.
    Now I live in Blois and I am in an IUT Networks and Telecommunications.</p>
    <p>When I have free time what I do most of the time is see my friends and go to the gym, I love football, I played it when I was smaller but I stopped but I still do it with my friends on football fields, the sport I currently practice is bodybuilding, it's a sport that I particularly enjoy doing . </p>
    <p>I'm a pretty stubborn person, when I have something in mind I keep it until I get there, I find that I'm a pretty generous person.</p>
    <p>I worked in my final year on a project which was to create an underwater drone which can be controlled remotely, I did the ITEC part which is the mechanical part but we were in a group of 5 including the people on the IT part.
        My grand oral exam was based on underwater drones, so I had to do a lot of research, which allowed me to learn a lot about computers.</p>
